Hello, my name is **Joseph Cruz**. I help software teams deliver valuable solutions with objective confidence. My value driven process and goal-oriented practices are the product of my uncommon **[INTP]({{ site.intp }})** personality and 20 years of studied practice. The result is an approach that begins and ends with observable results of value.

On this site, I hope to share some of my approach with you.
